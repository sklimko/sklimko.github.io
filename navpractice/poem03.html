		<div class="subhead"> By Donna </div> 
		<p>The past is the past for a reason.<br/>
		That is where it is supposed to stay,<br/>
		But some cannot let it go.<br/>
		In their heads it eats away</p>
		
		<p>Until all their focus becomes <br/>
		The person they used to be,<br/>
		The mistakes they made in their life.<br/>
		Oh, if only they could see</p>
		
		<p>That you cannot change what happened,<br/>
		No matter how hard you try,<br/>
		No matter how much you think about it,<br/>
		No matter how much you cry.</p>
		
		<p>What happens in your lifetime<br/>
		Happens for reasons unknown,<br/>
		So you have to let the cards unfold.<br/>
		Let your story be shown.</p>
		
		<p>Don’t get wrapped up in the negative.<br/>
		Be happy with what you have been given.<br/>
		Live for today not tomorrow.<br/>
		Get up, get out, and start living,</p>
		
		<p>Because the past is the past for a reason <br/>
		It’s been, and now it is gone,<br/>
		So stop trying to think of ways to fix it.<br/>
		It’s done, it’s unchangeable; move on.</p><br/>
